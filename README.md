# Advent of Code 2018

Join my private leaderboard!
Enter this code on the leaderboard page:
`31108-50673fef`.

The reality of me finishing this is low...
but Advent of Code is a great opportunity to get more familiar with a language.

This year,
I've chosen to use
`TypeScript`.

## Getting Started

To run the code,
first make sure you have Node.js installed.
Then,
open up a terminal and run:

```javascript
npm install
```

From here,
you can run
`npm start`
with the days you want to run:

```sh
# Runs Day 1's parts
npm start 1
npm start Day1

# Runs Day 1 and 2's parts
npm start 1 2
npm start Day1 Day2
```

The days are each a TypeScript class that extends a base AdeventOfCodeDay class.
It's a bit over-engineered for Advent,
but it was a good opportunity to refresh my OOP TypeScript skills.
